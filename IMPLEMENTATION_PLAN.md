## 🎯 Making It More Cohesive

### Current Issues:
```
❌ Data scattered across files
❌ No unified error handling  
❌ Frontend/backend disconnected
❌ Inconsistent data models
❌ No monitoring/alerting
```

### Proposed Unified Architecture:
```
✅ Single database schema
✅ Consistent API responses
✅ Unified error handling middleware
✅ Real-time data synchronization
✅ Comprehensive monitoring
```

### Implementation:
```python
# 1. Unified Data Layer
class UnifiedInsight:
    """Single insight model for all data types"""
    id: UUID
    type: InsightType  
    processor: str
    confidence: float
    business_impact: float
    created_at: datetime
    expires_at: datetime

# 2. Consistent API Responses
@dataclass
class APIResponse:
    success: bool
    data: Any
    errors: List[str] = None
    metadata: Dict = None

# 3. Real-time Updates
class InsightWebSocketManager:
    """Push insights to frontend in real-time"""
    async def broadcast_insight(self, insight: UnifiedInsight):
        await self.websocket.send(json.dumps(insight.dict()))
```
